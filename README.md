# seanchoi.space

This is my personal website and blog, built with Next.js and using Notion as a CMS.

## Features

*   **Blog with Notion:** The blog posts are fetched from a Notion database, using `notion-to-md` to convert the content to Markdown.
*   **Code Sandboxes:** The blog posts can include interactive code sandboxes using `@codesandbox/sandpack-react`.
*   **Analytics:** The website uses Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights to track user traffic and performance.
*   **CI/CD:** The website is automatically deployed to Vercel, and the Notion content is synced using a GitHub Actions workflow.
