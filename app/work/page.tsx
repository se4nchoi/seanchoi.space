          After completing the 1 year co-op at EMG, decided to stay 1 more year during summer 2022 - summer 2023 
          to gain further work experience, especially with a heightened interest in web technology. 
          Joined Hoek Agency who specialized in company branding/brand design, as an internal product developer.

          Worked at EMG Global during summer 2021 - summer 2022
          as a part of the Professional Experience Year co-op program at the University of Toronto.
          Wanted to be back with family during COVID while adding professional experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through many hands-on experience at this mobility start-up I was able to quickly learn everything  
          from linux FTP servers, fundamental web development, React.js webapp on Android, as well as a series of EV 
          hardware-software integrations â€” a big growth from being just an engineering student.
