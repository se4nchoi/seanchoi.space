I love to use Notion as my go-to writing tool, as it syncs neatly across all of my devices as well as produce clean Markdown outputs. Jotting down ideas and developing an idea into sharable pieces of writing have always been an enjoyable experience for me.


While there may be other ways to set up blogging, I wanted to leverage both Notion and my personal website.


## The Set Up


An abstracted architectural overview of my blogging set up is something like this:

I figured the setup was not complex enough to need a dedicated backend. I resorted to `'use server'` Next.js directive and `psql` package to service blog posts viewcounts — which I will probably discuss more on a different post. 


In this post, I wanted to focus on how to set up connections to Notion API to fetch your pages/contents.


## Packages


You need to install a few dependencies: 

- `@notionhq/client` to connect to Notion APIs
- `notion-to-md` to convert notion pages into MDX files
- `next-mdx-remote` to convert MDX files into custom React components.

Let’s go one by one to see how I’ve used them in my project.


## Notion Integrations


You need to first set up a Notion Integration and obtain your personal `NOTION_INTEGRATION_SECRET` from [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) .

If you create an integration (or already have an integration) you can obtain your notion secret in the integration settings. You need this integration secret to connect to your Notion database/page in your code.

Then you need to select which Notion database / page you want this integration to have access to.

With this set up complete on your Notion developer profile, you can now access it with code!


## Finding Data_Source_ID


As of September 3, 2025, Notion has bumped up their API versioning (a breaking change) to use `data_source_id` . My older script was failing to fetch the pages as it was only referring to the `database_id`.


You can grab your `data_source_id` from the Notion data source as described [here](https://developers.notion.com/docs/upgrade-guide-2025-09-03), but I got mine by accessing _Settings (of the data source) → Manage data sources → Copy data source ID,_ like so:

## Fetching Pages from Data Source


With the `data_source_id` specified, you can access the contents of that datasource with the right integration token, as shown on my `fetchNotionContents.ts` script. 


```typescript
import { Client } from '@notionhq/client';
import { NotionToMarkdown } from 'notion-to-md';

//...environment variable setup

const contentDir = path.join(process.cwd(), 'content');
const imageDir = path.join(process.cwd(), 'public', 'notion-images');
const notionIntegrationSecret = process.env.NOTION_INTEGRATION_SECRET;
const notionDataSourceId = process.env.NOTION_DATASOURCE_ID;

const notion = new Client({ 
  auth: notionIntegrationSecret,
  notionVersion: '2025-09-03', // bumped API version
 });
const n2m = new NotionToMarkdown({ notionClient: notion });
const dataSourceId = notionDataSourceId!;


const fetchPublishedPages = async () => {
	// ...logic for sync logging
	
	// request
	const response = await notion.dataSources.query({
    data_source_id: dataSourceId,
    filter: {
      property: 'Status',
      status: { equals: 'Published' },
      // many filtering options exist, but I only used 'Published' status
    },
  });
  
  for (const page of response.results) {
	  // logic for parsing page data
  }
	
}
```


Once I fetch the pages from Notion datasource, I parse them into the appropriate format and save them as an `.mdx` file. The `.mdx` files gets converted into React components later using `next-mdx-remote` package.


 


You can view the full logic and code on my [Github repo](https://github.com/se4nchoi/seanchoi.space) !


## Next…


With connection covered, I will dive into an **image problem** I had to resolve while using Notion as my blog post storage.


Stay tuned, and thank you for reading!
