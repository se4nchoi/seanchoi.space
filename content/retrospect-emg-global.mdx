## Before I Begin…


A little introduction of how I arrived at this position. 


My journey into professional software development began with a significant step at EMG Global. This role was particularly important as it fulfilled the professional experience hour requirement for my diploma, as part of the University of Toronto's Professional Experience Year co-op program. 


The timing coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, and a dose of homesickness, having no family in Canada, led me to seek a job back in Korea. After the one-year contract expired and I had over-fulfilled my work experience requirement, I didn’t want to return to school right away; I wanted more experience. 


Although EMG offered an upgraded compensation package if I were to stay in Korea, I was looking for something new, at a new place.

## Tangible Impact and Achievements


My contributions at EMG Global yielded several notable achievements:

- **Provincial Project Dashboard Delivery:** I was responsible for delivering the frontend of a pilot provincial project dashboard for a smart-city campaign. This dashboard played a crucial role in Daegu becoming a finalist for 4 billion KRW (approximately $4 million USD) in funding, demonstrating the direct impact of my development work.
- **Tech Stack Migration Co-Leadership:** I co-led the crucial tech stack migration of the smart-city project. This involved transitioning the frontend from jQuery to React.js and the backend from Spring to Spring Boot. This migration significantly modernized the project's architecture and improved its maintainability.
- **Developer Experience Improvement:** To enhance productivity, I implemented changes that reduced the development server startup time by 90% by utilizing Vite. This optimization directly improved the developer experience for the team.
- **Android WebView Application Delivery:** I developed and delivered an Android WebView application tailored for RUTA40 camping EV owners. This application significantly increased customer satisfaction.
- **Direct Business Impact:** My work on the RUTA40 website renewal directly contributed to the **complete sell-out of 20 camping cars in 3 days** following the exhibition and YouTube marketing.
